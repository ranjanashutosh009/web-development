        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br>

<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
    originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a
    cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally
    a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the
    most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or
    domestic fowl were typically used for this.Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
    were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).<sup><a
            href="source.com">[1][2]</a></sup> Humans now keep
    chickens
    primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pet </p>

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<h4>Social behaviour </h4>

<p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">flock</a> They have a communal approach to
    the incubation of eggs
    and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with
    dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
    causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
    younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[30] When a rooster finds food, he may call
    other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
    This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat. </p>
